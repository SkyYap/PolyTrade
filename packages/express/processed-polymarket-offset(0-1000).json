A 24h period of USDT below 98 cents that starts on the last day in 2025 will count.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is https://www.coinbase.com/, specifically the USDT-USD “High” prices currently available at https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/spot/USDT-USD with “1m” and “Candles” selected on the top bar. To see the “High” prices, mouse over particular candles and look at the value after “H” at the top of the chart.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Coinbase USDT-USD. If Coinbase stops having the necessary USDT information to resolve this market, a consensus of credible sources for whether USDT was below 98 cents for 24h+ may be used to resolve this market.",

If a bill extending the funding of the U.S. government is passed and signed by the acting President before October 1, 2025, 12:00 AM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor this market to resolve to \"Yes\" any funding lapse will count. If only a portion of the US government is covered by any signed bill(s) extending funding of the US government, and a portion of the US government goes unfunded, this market will still resolve to \"Yes\".\n\nThe primary resolution for this source will be official information from the US government, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

The ruling blocked several major measures, including the “Liberation Day” tariffs—a 10% tariff on all imports and country-specific rates of up to 50%—as well as additional tariffs targeting Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods. The Trump administration has filed a single consolidated appeal of this decision, titled V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if, by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, both of the following occur:\n\n1. The Trump administration’s appeal in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States is denied, in whole or in part\n\n2. U.S. importers receive refunds for at least some of the tariffs invalidated by the May 28, 2025 ruling.\n\nOtherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAnnouncements, court orders, or plans to issue refunds will not be sufficient for resolution unless actual refunds are issued within the market timeframe.\n\nIf the appeal is fully upheld and no refunds are issued, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official government or court information, or a consensus of credible reporting.\n",

Only a clear break in continuity—such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran.\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nNote: If the Iranian regime falls - as defined above - prior to a qualifying U.S. military action, this market will immediately resolve to \"No\".

(e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for October 28 - 29, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their October meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.\n",

Humanitarian pauses will not count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market's resolution will be based on official announcements from both Russia and Ukraine; however, a wide consensus of credible media reporting stating an official ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine has been reached will suffice.",

      "description": "This market will resolve to “Yes” if, according to the ISW map, Russia captures the Dorozhnje railway station located in Donetsk Oblast by August 31, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET.\n\nThe railroad station will be considered captured if any part of the train station icon is shaded red on the ISW map (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) by the resolution date. If the area is not shaded red by August 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to “No”.\n\nIf Russia comes into control of this territory as a result of a negotiated settlement, this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution, regardless of whether it is shaded red in the ISW map. An announcement of a negotiated settlement which gives Russia de jure control will not qualify. Actual control must be established.\n\nOnce Russia captures the railway station, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.\n\nTrain Station Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dorozhnie+train+station+zoom.png\n\nTrain station Location in Dorozhnje: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dorozhnie+train+station.png\n\nDorozhnje location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dorozhnie.png\n\nLocation on Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/2EoGpWbL1pks3U2S9\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map. If the ISW map is rendered unavailable, information from DeepStateMap (https://deepstatemap.live/) may be used. If information from both the ISW and DeepStateMap are rendered permanently unavailable, a consensus of credible reporting may be used.\n\nNote: Any temporary glitches or errors in the map will not be considered.",

Non-violent actions, such as warning shots, artillery fire into uninhabited areas, or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g., a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count toward a \"Yes\" resolution; however, minor damage (scrapes, dents) will not.\n\nMissiles or drones, which are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes, will not be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution regardless of whether they land on adversary territory or cause damage.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

Whether he actually resigns will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the US federal government; however, a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",
