The seasonally adjusted annualized percent change in quarterly U.S. real GDP from the previous quarter is less than 0.0 for two consecutive quarters between Q4 2024 and Q4 2025 (inclusive), as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). \n\nOtherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nNote that advance estimates will be considered. For example, if upon release, the advance estimate for Q2 2025 was negative, and the Q1 2025's most recent, up-to-date estimate was also negative, this market would resolve to \"Yes\". If on December 31, 2025 the latest estimate for quarterly GDP in Q3 2025 was negative, this market will stay open until the Advance estimate of Q4 2025 is published, at which point it will resolve to \"Yes\" if Q4 2025 was negative or if the NBER declares a recession by then.\n\nThe resolution source will be the official announcements from the NBER and the BEA’s estimate of seasonally adjusted annualized percent change in quarterly US real GDP from previous quarters as released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nBelow 98 cents means all candles in the period have a final “High” price below 0.98000 (i.e. 0.97999 or lower). A 24h period of USDT below 98 cents that starts on the last day in 2025 will count.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is https://www.coinbase.com/, specifically the USDT-USD “High” prices currently available at https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/spot/USDT-USD with “1m” and “Candles” selected on the top bar. To see the “High” prices, mouse over particular candles and look at the value after “H” at the top of the chart.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Coinbase USDT-USD. If Coinbase stops having the necessary USDT information to resolve this market, a consensus of credible sources for whether USDT was below 98 cents for 24h+ may be used to resolve this market.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nA funding lapse is defined as the President failing to sign the relevant bill(s) extending government funding by September 30, 11:59 PM ET.

If only a portion of the US government is covered by any signed bill(s) extending funding of the US government, and a portion of the US government goes unfunded, this market will still resolve to \"Yes\".\n\nThe primary resolution for this source will be official information from the US government, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

Suspended or symbolic life sentences will not count.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the first sentence rendered by the court regarding this case. Any appeals or subsequent changes to the sentence will have no bearing on resolution.\n\nIf Diddy's ongoing trial ends (e.g. mistrial) without the rendering of a sentence, this market will immediately resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official information from the U.S. court system; however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

Otherwise this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nActions which remove the general 10% tariff will qualify even if there are item specific exceptions for which the tariff still applies. However, lowering the general tariff below 10% without removing it will not qualify.\n\nAny action which is officially enacted within the market's time frame will qualify, regardless of when the removal goes into effect.\n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration, however a consensus of credible information will also be used.",

The ruling blocked several major measures, including the “Liberation Day” tariffs—a 10% tariff on all imports and country-specific rates of up to 50%—as well as additional tariffs targeting Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods. The Trump administration has filed a single consolidated appeal of this decision, titled V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if, by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, both of the following occur:\n\n1. The Trump administration’s appeal in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States is denied, in whole or in part\n\n2. U.S. importers receive refunds for at least some of the tariffs invalidated by the May 28, 2025 ruling.\n\nOtherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAnnouncements, court orders, or plans to issue refunds will not be sufficient for resolution unless actual refunds are issued within the market timeframe.\n\nIf the appeal is fully upheld and no refunds are issued, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be official government or court information, or a consensus of credible reporting.\n",

A human may be present in the vehicle or monitoring remotely for emergency intervention, but they must not be physically positioned to take control (for example, no safety driver in the driver’s seat) and must not actively steer, brake, accelerate, or otherwise drive the car under normal operation.\n\nA program that is restricted to Tesla employees, invite-only testers, closed-beta participants, factory self-delivery features, or the mere release of Full Self-Driving software for private owner-drivers will not qualify. Regulatory permits or approvals, press demonstrations, and prototype unveilings without live public ridership likewise will not count toward resolution.\n\nThis market’s resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

The US initiates a military action on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory or against any Iranian embassies or consulates between June 18, and December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nFor the purposes of this market, a \"military action\" will be considered to be any use of force executed by the US military on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory (e.g. if a weapons depot on Iranian soil is hit by an US missile) that is officially acknowledged by the US government or a consensus of credible reporting. This includes, but is not limited to, airstrikes, naval attacks, or ground invasions. Cyber attacks, sanctions, or diplomatic actions will not count towards the resolution of this market.\n\n\n2. The Islamic Republic of Iran’s current ruling regime is NOT overthrown, collapsed, or otherwise ceases to govern by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran’s current ruling regime will be considered overthrown if a broad consensus of reporting indicating that core structures of the Islamic Republic (e.g. the office of the Supreme Leader, the Guardian Council, IRGC control under clerical authority) have been dissolved, incapacitated, or replaced by a fundamentally different governing system or otherwise lost de facto power over a majority of the population of Iran. This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.\n\nRoutine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic’s core structures also do not qualify. Only a clear break in continuity—such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran.\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nNote: If the Iranian regime falls - as defined above - prior to a qualifying U.S. military action, this market will immediately resolve to \"No\".

This market will resolve once all three sources have conclusively called winners of the House and Senate in the 2026 United States midterm elections.

Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No\".\n\nGolfers who are named to the team but later withdraw or do not participate due to injury, suspension, personal reasons, or any other reason will still resolve to \"Yes\" if they were officially named prior to the start of the competition.\n\nAny replacement player who is officially added to the playing roster due to a withdrawal will also resolve to \"Yes\", provided their addition is confirmed before September 24, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET.\n\nGolfers who serve in non-playing roles (e.g. vice captains, advisors, or other support roles) and are not part of the active playing roster will not qualify.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be the official announcement by Team Europe or Ryder Cup Europe.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purposes of this market, a qualifying \"strike\" is defined as the use of aerial bombs, drones or missiles (including cruise or ballistic missiles) launched by Israeli military forces that impact Syrian ground territory or any official Syrian embassy or consulate (e.g., if a weapons depot on Syrian soil is hit by an Israeli missile, this market will resolve to \"Yes\") that is officially acknowledged by the Israeli government or a consensus of credible reporting.\n\nMissiles or drones which are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution regardless of whether they land on Syrian territory or cause damage.\n\nActions such as artillery fire, small arms fire, FPV or ATGM strikes directly, ground incursions, naval shelling, cyberattacks, or other operations conducted by Israeli ground operatives will not qualify.\n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

If the area is not shaded red by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to “No”.\n\nIf Russia comes into control of this territory as a result of a negotiated settlement, this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution, regardless of whether it is shaded red in the ISW map. An announcement of a negotiated settlement which gives Russia de jure control will not qualify. Actual control must be established.\n\nOnce Russia captures the railroad station, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.\n\nTrain station location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/slovyansk+train+station+zoom.png\n\nTrain station Location in Slovyansk: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/slovyansk+train+station.jpeg\n\nSlovyansk Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/slovyansk.jpeg\n\nLocation on Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/FnDJ8Xur2CzKvGC76?g_st=isi\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map. If the ISW map is rendered unavailable, information from DeepStateMap (https://deepstatemap.live/) may be used. If information from both the ISW and DeepStateMap are rendered permanently unavailable, a consensus of credible reporting may be used.\n\nNote: Any temporary glitches or errors in the map will not be considered.",

Non-violent actions, such as warning shots, artillery fire into uninhabited areas, or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g., a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count toward a \"Yes\" resolution; however, minor damage (scrapes, dents) will not.\n\nMissiles or drones, which are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes, will not be sufficient for a \"Yes\" resolution regardless of whether they land on adversary territory or cause damage.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nIf such an agreement is officially reached before the resolution date, this market will resolve to \"Yes\", regardless of if/when the agreement goes into effect.\n\nAgreements to extend tariff exemptions will qualify if announced as an individualized extension. However, tariff exemptions which are announced as part of a class of exemptions and do not reflect individual deals - such as Trump’s April 9 pause on all reciprocal tariffs other than those on China - will not qualify (see: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-trading-partner-retaliation-and-alignment/).  \n\nInformal and unilateral announcements which do not constitute a finalized agreement will not count.\n \nAgreements that include the United States and the listed country/entity as parties, even if they also involve other countries, will qualify for resolution.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting confirming an agreement has been reached.\n",

Informal statements, plans contingent on future conditions, statements of intent without a formal policy directive, or any other statements that do not constitute a formal policy announcement will not be considered.\n\nPrimary resolution sources will include official statements from Hamas leadership; however, a wide consensus of credible reporting confirming a policy of disarmament has been instituted will also qualify.",

The decisions on the target federal fund range are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.\n\nThis market will resolve to the amount of basis points the upper bound of the target federal funds rate is changed by versus the level it was prior to the Federal Reserve's December 2025 meeting.\n\nIf the target federal funds rate is changed to a level not expressed in the displayed options, the change will be rounded up to the nearest 25 and will resolve to the relevant bracket. (e.g. if there's a cut/increase of 12.5 bps it will be considered to be 25 bps)\n\nThe resolution source for this market is the FOMC’s statement after its meeting scheduled for December 9 - 10, 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\nThe level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\nThis market may resolve as soon as the FOMC’s statement for their December meeting with relevant data is issued. If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.\n",
